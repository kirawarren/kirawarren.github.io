    <h1> hi! my name is kira warren!! </h1>
    My pronouns are <i> she/her</i> and I am from Parker, CO! I am a CTD major and a Comp Sci minor! <br>
    A fun fact about me is that I am in an a capella group called On The Rocks! <br>
    I'm super excited for this class because I love front end development and I'm excited to learn more about it! <br>
    I wouldn't say I have a favorite youtube video, BUT I've been obsessed with this song and music video recently:</p>
